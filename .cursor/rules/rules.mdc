## 1. Anchor comments

Add specially formatted comments throughout the codebase, where appropriate, for yourself as inline knowledge that can be easily `grep`ped for. 

### Guidelines:

- Use `AIDEV-NOTE:`, `AIDEV-TODO:`, or `AIDEV-QUESTION:` (all-caps prefix) for comments aimed at AI and developers.
- Keep them concise (â‰¤ 120 chars).
- **Important:** Before scanning files, always first try to **locate existing anchors** `AIDEV-*` in relevant subdirectories.
- **Update relevant anchors** when modifying associated code.
- **Do not remove `AIDEV-NOTE`s** without explicit human instruction.
- Make sure to add relevant anchor comments, whenever a file or piece of code is:
  * too long, or
  * too complex, or
  * very important, or
  * confusing, or
  * could have a bug unrelated to the task you are currently working on.

Example:
```python
# AIDEV-NOTE: perf-hot-path; avoid extra allocations (see ADR-24)
async def render_feed(...):
    ...
```
