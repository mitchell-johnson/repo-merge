## Detailed Results

### ✅ Basic Functionality Tests (8/8)
All core functionality is working correctly:
- T001: Simple repository merge
- T002: Multiple branches merge
- T005: Commit history preservation
- T010: Subdirectory merge
- T020: Specific branch merge
- T030: Skip tags option
- T050: Dry run mode
- T040/T041: Existing branches handling

### ✅ Error Handling Tests (9/9)
All error cases are handled properly:
- T070: Invalid repository URL
- T071: Invalid source name
- T072: Not in a git repository
- T073: Missing required arguments
- T074: Conflicting options
- T080: Empty repository merge
- T083: Very long branch names
- T084: Special characters handling
- Help option functionality

### ⚠️ Additional Test Cases (5/9)

**Passing:**
- T003: Merge repo with tags
- T004: Merge repo with branches and tags
- T021: Non-existent branch merge - ✅ **FIXED**: Script now properly validates branch existence
- T031-T033: Various tag types
- T082: Repository with submodules

**Failing:**
- T006: Author/timestamp preservation - Script exits with error
- T011: Nested subdirectory merge - Files not in expected location
- T012: Subdirectory with multiple branches - Files not in expected location
- T091: Many branches handling - Script exits with error

### ⚠️ Advanced Features Tests (1/5)

**Passing:**
- T063: Different merge strategies

**Failing:**
- T060: Auto-merge with -m flag - Merge commit not created
- T061: Squash merge - Squash commit not created
- T062: No-commit merge - No staged changes found
- T064: Preserve paths option - Files not at original paths

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### Script Bugs Fixed

1. **git-merge-repos.zsh - Branch Validation** ✅ **FIXED**
   - Added validation to check if requested branch exists in source repository
   - Script now properly fails with error message when non-existent branch is specified
   - Added check to ensure at least one branch is created when specific branch is requested

### Remaining Script Issues

1. **git-merge-repos.zsh**:
   - May have issues with many branches (20+) - needs investigation
   - Subdirectory functionality may not work correctly on all branches

2. **git-merge-repos-advanced.zsh**:
   - Auto-merge (`-m`) may not be creating merge commits properly
   - `--squash-merge` option may not be working as expected
   - `--no-commit` option may not be leaving changes staged
   - `-p` (preserve paths) may still be prefixing branch names

### Test Infrastructure
All test infrastructure issues have been resolved:
- ✅ Test framework properly returns exit codes
- ✅ Script paths are correctly resolved
- ✅ Test utilities work as expected
- ✅ New test files created for comprehensive coverage

## Code Changes Made

### git-merge-repos.zsh
```zsh
# Added branch validation after fetch
if [[ -n "$SPECIFIC_BRANCH" ]]; then
    if [[ "$DRY_RUN" == false ]]; then
        if ! git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/remotes/$REMOTE_NAME/$SPECIFIC_BRANCH"; then
            print_color $RED "Error: Branch '$SPECIFIC_BRANCH' does not exist in source repository"
            git remote remove "$REMOTE_NAME" 2>/dev/null || true
            exit 1
        fi
    fi
    BRANCHES=("$SPECIFIC_BRANCH")
```

### Test Infrastructure
- Created `test/test_additional_cases.zsh` with 9 additional test cases
- Created `test/test_advanced_features.zsh` with 5 advanced feature tests
- Updated `test/run_all_tests.zsh` to include new test suites
- Fixed test command syntax for advanced script options

## Recommendations

1. ~~Fix the branch validation in git-merge-repos.zsh~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
2. Debug the subdirectory rewriting logic for multiple branches
3. Review the advanced script's merge functionality to ensure commits are created properly
4. Add more detailed error output to help diagnose failures
5. Consider adding verbose/debug mode to scripts for troubleshooting
6. Investigate performance issues with many branches (20+)
